Paragraph with text. Lorem ipsum *bla*.

* a normal list
* another point in this list

<!-- we have to seperate adjacent lists with a comment or they BECOME ONE -->

* first row		second column
* stuff			and *more* stuff
* this row should be colspanned

now let's [have](http://jakobwierzba.de "title") [some][link] [obvious][slink] links to the outside world. [this one](/local/ "local") should be unaffected.
